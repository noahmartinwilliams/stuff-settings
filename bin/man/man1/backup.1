backup - backup your data.

.SH SYNOPSIS
backup -r -i [ip address] -u [username] -s [source directory] -d [destination directory]
.br
backup -s [source directory] -d [destination directory]

.SH DESCRIPTION
Backup is the best command in the history of forever because it does snapshot 
backups for you. It does this thanks to the magic of being a shell script
wrapper for someone else's crap. It can do both local, and remote backups
using the magic of ssh.

Note: if there is a file named ".exclude" in the source directory, then
