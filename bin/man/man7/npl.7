.TH NPL version-1
.SH Preamble
	The licenses for most software products try to take away the user's rights.
Many licenses have been put forth to fix this, however they seem to either take away the rights of the
developers, or complicate the terms of the license to no end. This is a license designed to be simple, flexible,
yet at the same time useful.

.SH Terms definitions
This section defines certain terms used in the rest of the license.

.B source code: 
the machine readable code that was used to develope the software for example: c files, fortran files, makefiles, etc, etc

.B distributor: 
one who distributes a program.

.B you: 
the person, or party reading this license\.

.B original author: 
the person or persons who developed the software product in question, and have copyrighted it\.

.B the program:
the sotware that was copyrighted under this license\.

.SH Terms for reproduction
	This license is a free software license (or atleast it claims to be one)\.

As such copies and changes may be made to the software with little restriction\. However when distributing these

copies the following are the rules that the distributor must follow:


	*The distributor must give credit to the original creator of the program\.

	This will be accepted in one of the following ways:


		1\. If the program has a graphical user interface, then the program must have an "about this program" 
		button that can be clicked which will give the version, and tell the user that the program they are 
		using has been modified\.


		2\. If the program is a command line interface program, then there will only need to be a flag that needs 
		to be passed in order for it tell the user the version of the program, and tell the user that it has 
		been modified\.


	*The distributor must mention whether or not warranty protection is given\. If there is no mention of a 
	warranty, then the software is not covered under warranty protection\.
	

	*Source code for those changes must be made available in one of the following ways:

		1\. A repository of the source code must be online on either a website that was specified as the source 
		code repository by the distributor\.


		2\. The source code must be given on the same form of medium that the software was exchanged on\.
	

		3\. The software must be given as source code that must be compiled (not recommended)\.

.SH Clarifications
Often times technical complications will arise, and these will bring with them questions about how these problems are dealt
with by this license, to clarify:


*The program that is put under this license may be linked to proprietary libraries so long as the user is informed before it
is installed, and the user must approve of it during installation\.


*Compilers and interpreters do not count as source code\. however any scripts used specifically for working on the program
do count as source code\.

*Code may be copied from the software to another project, so long as the project has a notice indicating that it uses
source code from an NPL program. The exact program must be named, and the code that was copied must be displayed in the 
copyright notice.  Programs that use code that is copied from 
an NPL program may be under any license, so long as they follow this rule.
